# Gemini: RAG with Google Gemini and FAISS

Welcome to the Gemini repository, where we integrate the power of Google Gemini with the Retriever-Augmented Generation (RAG) model and FAISS vector storage for advanced text retrieval and generation.

## Overview

Gemini is a project that leverages Google Gemini's capabilities along with the RAG model to enhance text extraction and generation. The FAISS vector store is used to efficiently manage and retrieve large-scale data for the RAG model.

## Requirements

- Python 3.8+
- PyTorch 1.8+
- Transformers 4.5+
- FAISS
- Google Cloud Platform account

## Files

- `rag.py`: The main script for the RAG model using Google Gemini.
- `db.py`: Database management script utilizing FAISS for efficient vector storage and retrieval.

## Notebook

`extract_text_from_image.ipynb` is a Jupyter notebook that demonstrates the process of text extraction from images using the combined capabilities of RAG and Google Gemini.

## Setup

To set up your environment for using Gemini, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ``` bash
   git clone https://github.com/imanoop7/gemini.git
2. Install the required dependencies:
   ``` bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
3. Configure your Gemini credentials.
4. Run the scripts or notebook


## Usage

With Gemini, you can perform advanced text retrieval and generation tasks, leveraging the speed of Google Gemini and the efficiency of FAISS vector storage.
